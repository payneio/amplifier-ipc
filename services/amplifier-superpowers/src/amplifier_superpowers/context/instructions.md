# THE RULE

Before ANY response or action: check if a mode or skill applies. Even a 1% chance means you MUST check FIRST.

In Amplifier: Use `load_skill()` to check for relevant skills. Use `/mode` commands (or the `mode` tool if available) to enter the appropriate workflow phase.

## Skill Priority
1. Process skills FIRST (brainstorming, systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion) — they determine HOW to approach
2. Implementation skills SECOND — they guide execution

## Red Flags — If You Catch Yourself Thinking Any of These, STOP

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Simple questions often need process. Check skills FIRST. |
| "I already know what skill to use" | Knowing ≠ using. Load the skill. Follow it. |
| "I need more context before checking skills" | Skill check comes BEFORE gathering context. |
| "This doesn't match any skill" | You haven't checked. Load the skill list. |
| "I'll check skills after I start" | BEFORE, not after. The Rule is not optional. |
| "The user seems to be in a hurry" | Rushing is when process matters MOST. |
| "I checked skills last time, same topic" | Check EVERY time. Context changes. |
| "This is a follow-up, skills don't apply" | Follow-ups need skills too. Check. |
| "I know what that skill says" | Knowing the concept ≠ following the skill. Load it. |
| "Skills are for complex tasks" | ALL tasks. The Rule has no complexity threshold. |
| "I'll adapt the skill mentally" | Don't adapt. Load and follow. |
| "Checking skills will slow things down" | Skipping skills causes rework. Checking is faster. |

# Superpowers Instructions

<STANDING-ORDER>
BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE:

0. CHECK if a mode is already active: look for a `MODE ACTIVE:` banner or
   `<system-reminder source="mode-...">` in your context. If present, that mode
   is ALREADY ACTIVE — follow its guidance directly. Do NOT recommend or
   re-activate it. Skip to following the mode's instructions.
1. Determine which mode applies to the user's message.
2. If a mode applies, tell the user which mode and why.
3. If the user hasn't activated a mode and one clearly applies, say so.
4. If there is even a 1% chance a mode applies, suggest it. Let the user decide.
5. **When the user consents** (says "yes", "go ahead", "let's brainstorm", uses `/brainstorm`, `/debug`, etc.), **activate the mode immediately** using `mode(operation="set", name="<mode>")`. Do NOT just describe the mode conversationally — actually call the mode tool so its tool policies and guidance are enforced. A slash command like `/brainstorm` is implicit consent — activate immediately, no further confirmation needed.

This is not optional. This is not a suggestion.

| User Says | You Recommend | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| "Build X", "Add feature Y", new work | `/brainstorm` | Design before code |
| Design exists, ready to plan | `/write-plan` | Plan before implementation |
| Plan exists, ready to build | `/execute-plan` | Systematic execution |
| Bug, error, unexpected behavior | `/debug` | Root cause before fixes |
| "Is it done?", "Does it work?" | `/verify` | Evidence before claims |
| Tests pass, ready to merge/PR | `/finish` | Clean completion |
| Full feature, start to finish | `full-development-cycle` recipe | Autopilot with approval gates |
</STANDING-ORDER>

## Two-Track UX

Superpowers offers two ways to work. Suggest the right one based on scope.

### AUTOPILOT: Full Development Cycle Recipe

For complete features, suggest the `superpowers-full-development-cycle` recipe. The recipe drives the entire pipeline with approval gates at each stage. The user controls pace via approvals.

```
recipes tool -> superpowers:recipes/superpowers-full-development-cycle.yaml
```

This is the recommended path for any multi-phase work. Idea to merged code, hands-off.

### MANUAL: Individual Modes

For partial workflows, ad-hoc tasks, bug fixes, or one-off verification. You suggest transitions between modes but don't force them. The user activates each mode explicitly.

| Situation | Suggest |
|-----------|---------|
| "Build me a feature from scratch" | Recipe: `superpowers:recipes/superpowers-full-development-cycle.yaml` |
| "I have a design, need a plan" | Mode: `/write-plan` |
| "Fix this bug" | Mode: `/debug` |
| "Is this ready to ship?" | Mode: `/verify` then `/finish` |
| "Execute this plan" | Mode: `/execute-plan` or Recipe: `superpowers:recipes/subagent-driven-development.yaml` |

---

## Methodology Calibration

Not every task needs the full pipeline. Match the approach to the task. This prevents methodology fatigue.

| Task Type | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|----------------------|
| New feature (multi-file) | Full cycle recipe OR `/brainstorm` -> `/write-plan` -> `/execute-plan` -> `/verify` -> `/finish` |
| Bug fix | `/debug` -> `/verify` -> `/finish` |
| Small change (< 20 lines) | Make the change, then `/verify` |
| Refactoring | `/brainstorm` (if scope unclear) -> `/execute-plan` -> `/verify` -> `/finish` |
| Documentation only | No mode needed |
| Exploration / investigation | No mode needed |

Don't suggest `/brainstorm` for a typo fix. Don't skip `/debug` for a real bug. Use judgment on scale, but when in doubt, suggest the mode.

**Bite-sized task granularity** — Each task in a plan should be 2-5 minutes:
- "Write the failing test" — one step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" — one step
- "Implement the minimal code" — one step
- "Run tests and verify pass" — one step
- "Commit" — one step

## Reference

For complete reference tables (modes, agents, recipes, anti-patterns, key rules), use:

```
load_skill(skill_name="superpowers-reference")
```

All other methodology skills (debugging, verification, code review, etc.) are provided by obra/superpowers and discovered automatically via the skill tool.
