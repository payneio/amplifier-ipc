# Amplifier IPC Microservices Architecture Design

## Goal

Transform amplifier-ipc from a stdio-based, host-mediated IPC architecture into a Dapr-native microservices framework where each behavior runs as an independent container communicating via HTTP/gRPC and pub/sub.

## Background

amplifier-ipc is currently a process-isolated service architecture for AI agent orchestration. A central Host spawns service subprocesses per user turn, communicating via JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio. The project is a mono-repo with 13 service directories under `services/`.

The current architecture has fundamental limitations:

- **Per-turn lifecycle**: Services spawn fresh and die after each turn (~200ms overhead). The ServiceIndex is rebuilt from scratch every turn.
- **stdio transport**: Single-machine only, newline-delimited JSON. No network distribution possible.
- **Host = broker**: The 1248-line Host monolith mediates every message between every service. All tool calls, hook events, and provider requests flow through it.
- **Python-only**: Despite multi-language goals, the custom JSON-RPC protocol and Python-specific `Server` class make non-Python services impractical.
- **The `_OrchestratorLocalClient` monolith**: The foundation service co-locates orchestrator + tools + hooks + context in a single process to avoid IPC deadlock. This defeats the purpose of process isolation.

These constraints cannot be incrementally fixed. A clean architectural break is required.

## Approach

Replace the entire IPC layer with Dapr-native microservices. This is a clean break -- no backward compatibility with the spawn-per-turn model. The key decisions:

1. **Dapr as the service mesh** -- Provides service invocation (mTLS, retries, circuit breakers), pub/sub (streaming, hook fan-out), state store (session persistence), and observability out of the box.
2. **One behavior = one container** -- Every behavior (tool, hook, provider group) runs as its own container. This is aggressive decomposition, enabled by a shared base image and thin SDK.
3. **Orchestrator drives the loop directly** -- The orchestrator calls tools and providers via Dapr service invocation, not through the Session Service. The Session Service handles session lifecycle only.
4. **Standard HTTP endpoints** -- No custom protocol. Services are ordinary HTTP servers with well-known endpoint paths.
5. **No caching** -- Session Service calls `/describe` every turn. Simplicity over premature optimization.

### Component Roles

- **CLI** -- Runs on the user's machine (not a container). Resolves workspace content (`@mentions`, `.amplifier/` files, `AGENTS.md`), sends resolved content + prompt as an HTTP/gRPC payload to the Session Service. Subscribes to a streaming topic to receive real-time tokens and events.

- **Session Service** (formerly Host) -- Containerized service for session lifecycle only. Receives prompts with resolved content, resolves agent/behavior definitions, calls `/describe` on active services to build the routing table and collect content manifests, assembles the system prompt from service content + workspace content, invokes the orchestrator via Dapr service invocation, persists transcripts via Dapr state store, and streams events back to the CLI. Not in the hot path for tool/provider/hook calls.

- **Orchestrator Service** -- Drives the agent loop. Receives the routing table as input (which tool lives at which Dapr app-id). Calls providers, tools, and hooks directly via Dapr service invocation and pub/sub. No longer routes through the Session Service for runtime messages.

- **Capability Services** -- Provider, tool, hook, mode, skills, etc. containers. Each exposes well-known HTTP/gRPC endpoints following a simple contract. Split by behavior -- each behavior becomes its own container.

- **Dapr Sidecars** -- Every container gets a Dapr sidecar providing service invocation (with mTLS, retries, circuit breakers), pub/sub (for streaming and hook fan-out), state store (for session state), and observability.

## Components

### Service Contract

Services are standard HTTP (or gRPC) apps that expose well-known endpoints. No custom protocol library required.

#### Endpoint Contracts by Component Type

| Component Type | Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Provider | `/providers/{name}/complete` | POST | Takes a chat request, returns completion |
| Provider | `/providers/{name}/stream` | POST | Publishes tokens to session's pub/sub topic |
| Tool | `/tools/{name}/execute` | POST | Takes tool input, returns tool result |
| Hook | *(none -- subscribes to pub/sub topics)* | -- | Hooks subscribe to event topics, no endpoint needed |
| Context | `/context/messages` | GET/POST | Get/set conversation messages |
| Orchestrator | `/orchestrator/execute` | POST | Accepts session config + prompt. Publishes stream events to the session's pub/sub topic. Returns final result when the agent loop completes. |
| Describe | `/describe` | GET | Returns capability manifest (what tools/providers/hooks this service offers) + content manifest |
| Content | `/content/{path}` | GET | Serves content files (context docs, agent definitions, recipes) on demand |
| Health | `/healthz` | GET | Dapr-standard health check |

#### Key Changes from Current IPC

- **Hooks shift to pub/sub**: From "Host calls each hook sequentially" to "orchestrator publishes event, hooks subscribe via Dapr pub/sub." Enables parallel hook execution and decouples the orchestrator from knowing which hooks exist.
- **`/describe` replaces JSON-RPC `describe`**: Same purpose (capability discovery), standard HTTP.
- **No custom Server/Client classes**: Services use any HTTP framework (FastAPI, Flask, Express, Go `net/http`, etc.).
- **Optional Python SDK**: Provides convenience decorators and Pydantic request/response models. Not required.

### Service Ontology

There is **one kind of service**. Every service:

1. Has a Dapr app-id
2. Responds to `GET /describe` with its capability + content manifest
3. Serves content via `GET /content/{path}`
4. Optionally exposes tool, hook, and/or provider endpoints
5. Optionally subscribes to pub/sub topics (hooks)

The variation is in what capabilities a service offers, not in what "type" it is.

#### Behavior Composition

The behavior YAML remains the composition unit. It declares which services to include and which of their capabilities to activate:

```
Agent Definition (foundation-agent.yaml)
  └─ composes Behaviors (agents.yaml, logging.yaml, redaction.yaml, ...)
       └─ each behavior activates components from Services
            └─ each service is a Dapr container exposing
               /describe + /content + capability endpoints
```

#### Content Model

- **Service content** stays in the service container. Services carry their content and serve it via `/describe` (manifests at session start) and `/content/{path}` (on-demand file retrieval).
- **Content-only services** are still containers -- they just respond to `/describe` and `/content` with no capability endpoints.
- **Workspace-local content** (`.amplifier/AGENTS.md`, local `@mentions`) is resolved by the CLI and sent as part of the API payload to the Session Service. This is the "content-in-request" pattern -- CLI reads local files, serializes as JSON, includes in the request body.
- Service content + workspace content are combined by the Session Service when assembling the system prompt.

## Data Flow

### Communication Patterns

Three communication patterns cover all interactions:

#### Pattern 1: Request/Response (Dapr Service Invocation)

**Used for:** tool execution, provider completion, `/describe`, `/content/{path}`, pre-hooks

The orchestrator calls a tool or provider and waits for the result. Dapr service invocation provides mTLS, retries, and circuit breakers automatically.

#### Pattern 2: Pub/Sub with Streaming Subscriptions (Token Streaming)

**Used for:** streaming LLM tokens from provider through orchestrator to CLI

The orchestrator publishes tokens to a session-scoped topic as they arrive from the provider. The Session Service or CLI subscribes via Dapr streaming subscriptions and renders in real-time. Dapr streaming subscriptions (since v1.14) support pull-based message delivery over gRPC without needing an HTTP endpoint.

#### Pattern 3: Pub/Sub with Declarative Subscriptions (Hook Events)

**Used for:** lifecycle events (`session:start`, `tool:pre`, `tool:post`, `provider:request`, etc.)

The orchestrator publishes hook events to a topic. Hook services subscribe declaratively. Replaces current sequential fan-out with parallel, decoupled event handling.

#### Hook Modification Pattern

For hooks that need to inspect and modify requests (pre-hooks), the orchestrator uses request/response service invocation (sequential). For post-hooks (observation only), pub/sub (parallel, fire-and-forget).

| Hook Timing | Pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `*:pre` events | Service invocation (sequential) | May modify or block the request |
| `*:post` events | Pub/sub (parallel) | Observation only |

### Session Lifecycle

#### Phase 1: Session Setup (CLI + Session Service)

1. User types prompt in CLI
2. CLI resolves local content (`.amplifier/AGENTS.md`, settings, workspace `@mentions`)
3. CLI sends HTTP request to Session Service: `POST /sessions/{id}/turn` with prompt, workspace_content, agent_ref
4. Session Service resolves agent definition -> determines active behaviors -> determines needed services
5. Session Service calls `GET /describe` on each needed service -> builds capability routing table + collects content manifests
6. Session Service calls `GET /content/{path}` for needed context files
7. Session Service assembles full system prompt: service content + workspace content + conversation history

#### Phase 2: Agent Loop (Orchestrator Drives)

8. Session Service invokes orchestrator: `POST /orchestrator/execute` with system_prompt, messages, config, routing_table
9. Orchestrator enters the agent loop:
   - a. Calls pre-hooks via service invocation (sequential, may modify)
   - b. Calls provider via service invocation
   - c. Provider tokens published to pub/sub topic -> CLI renders
   - d. On tool call: calls pre-hooks, executes tool, publishes post-hook events
   - e. Repeats until LLM signals completion
10. Orchestrator publishes completion event

#### Phase 3: Teardown

11. Session Service receives completion
12. Persists transcript to Dapr state store
13. Returns final result to CLI

**Key difference from today:** The orchestrator receives the routing table as input rather than discovering it at runtime.

## Deployment

### Full Behavior-Level Decomposition

`amplifier-foundation` is split by behavior. Each behavior becomes its own container. All services share a base image.

#### From amplifier-foundation (Split by Behavior)

| Container | From Behavior | Components |
|---|---|---|
| `svc-orchestrator` | (core) | StreamingOrchestrator + SimpleContextManager |
| `svc-delegate` | agents | DelegateTool |
| `svc-task` | tasks | TaskTool |
| `svc-todo` | todo-reminder | TodoTool + TodoReminderHook + TodoDisplayHook |
| `svc-bash` | (tool) | BashTool |
| `svc-filesystem` | (tool) | ReadTool, WriteTool, EditTool |
| `svc-search` | (tool) | GrepTool, GlobTool |
| `svc-web` | (tool) | WebSearchTool, WebFetchTool |
| `svc-logging` | logging | LoggingHook |
| `svc-redaction` | redaction | RedactionHook |
| `svc-sessions` | sessions | SessionNamingHook + content |
| `svc-status-context` | status-context | StatusContextHook |
| `svc-progress-monitor` | progress-monitor | ProgressMonitorHook |
| `svc-streaming-ui` | streaming-ui | StreamingUiHook |

#### Already-Separate Services (Unchanged)

| Container | Components |
|---|---|
| `svc-providers` | 8 LLM providers |
| `svc-modes` | ModeTool + ModeHook |
| `svc-routing` | RoutingHook |
| `svc-skills` | SkillsTool |

#### Content Services (Serve /describe + /content Only)

| Container |
|---|
| `svc-core` |
| `svc-amplifier` |
| `svc-browser-tester` |
| `svc-design-intelligence` |
| `svc-filesystem-content` |
| `svc-recipes` |
| `svc-superpowers` |
| `svc-system-design-intelligence` |

#### Infrastructure

| Container | Role |
|---|---|
| `session-service` | Session lifecycle gateway |
| `redis` | Dapr state store + pub/sub broker |

**Total: ~28 application containers + redis + Dapr sidecars**

The CLI is NOT a container. It runs on the user's machine.

### Shared Service SDK & Base Image

With ~28 containers, developer experience and operational overhead must be minimal. A shared base image and thin SDK make this practical.

#### The SDK (`amplifier-service-sdk`)

A small Python library that provides:

1. **Request/response models** -- Pydantic v2 models for all endpoint contracts: `DescribeResponse`, `ToolRequest`, `ToolResult`, `ProviderRequest`, `ProviderResponse`, `HookEvent`, `HookResult`, `ContentRequest`, `ContentResponse`
2. **A generic service runner** -- Given a service definition (YAML or Python config), starts a FastAPI app with `/describe` and `/content/{path}` endpoints pre-wired. The developer only adds their capability endpoints.
3. **Optional convenience decorators** -- Not required. For developer ergonomics only.
4. **Content serving** -- Automatic serving of `.md`/`.yaml` files from a configured content directory. Zero code needed for content-only services.

#### Base Image

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
RUN pip install amplifier-service-sdk uvicorn
# That's it. Every service layers on top.
```

#### Three Patterns for Building Service Images

**Pattern 1: Content-only service (zero custom code)**

```dockerfile
FROM amplifier-service-base
COPY content/ /app/content/
COPY describe.yaml /app/
CMD ["amplifier-serve", "--config", "/app/describe.yaml"]
```

**Pattern 2: Single-tool service (minimal code)**

```dockerfile
FROM amplifier-service-base
COPY src/ /app/src/
CMD ["amplifier-serve", "--module", "my_tool"]
```

**Pattern 3: Rich service like providers (custom deps)**

```dockerfile
FROM amplifier-service-base
RUN pip install anthropic openai google-generativeai
COPY src/ /app/src/
CMD ["amplifier-serve", "--module", "providers"]
```

Content-only services can share a single generic image parameterized by mounted `service.yaml` and content directory.

#### What a Developer Needs to Create a New Service

1. Write a Python file with their tool/hook/provider implementation
2. Write a `describe.yaml` listing capabilities and content
3. `FROM amplifier-service-base` + `COPY` + `CMD`
4. Add to `docker-compose.yaml`

## Error Handling

Error handling is delegated to Dapr's built-in mechanisms:

- **Service invocation**: Dapr provides automatic retries with configurable backoff, circuit breakers for failing services, and mTLS for transport security.
- **Pub/sub**: Dapr handles message delivery guarantees and dead-letter topics for failed hook event processing.
- **Health checks**: Every service exposes `/healthz`. Dapr monitors service health and removes unhealthy instances from the service mesh.
- **State store**: Dapr provides transactional state operations for session persistence via Redis.

Application-level errors (tool execution failures, provider errors) are returned as structured error responses through the standard request/response contract. The orchestrator handles these within the agent loop, just as it does today.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Tool, hook, and provider implementations are tested in isolation, independent of the service framework. Business logic does not change.
- **Contract tests**: Each service's `/describe` response and endpoint contracts are validated against the SDK's Pydantic models.
- **Integration tests**: Docker Compose brings up the full service mesh. Tests exercise the complete session lifecycle: CLI -> Session Service -> Orchestrator -> Tools/Providers -> CLI.
- **Service-level tests**: Individual services are tested with their Dapr sidecar to verify pub/sub subscriptions, state operations, and service invocation work correctly.

## Migration Path

This is a clean break rewrite of the infrastructure layer, not a refactoring of business logic:

| What | Changes | Doesn't Change |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | stdio -> HTTP/gRPC via Dapr | Tool/hook/provider implementation code |
| Service runner | Custom `Server` class -> SDK + FastAPI | What each tool/hook/provider does |
| Discovery | `scan_package()` + JSON-RPC `describe` -> `/describe` HTTP endpoint | Behavior YAML definitions |
| Host | 1248-line monolith -> thin Session Service | Session lifecycle concept |
| State | Custom `state.json` -> Dapr state store | State semantics |
| Streaming | stdio interleaving -> Dapr pub/sub | Token-level streaming to CLI |
| Content | In-process `scan_content()` -> `/content/{path}` endpoint | Content files themselves |
| CLI | Imports Host as library -> HTTP client to Session Service | User-facing commands, REPL |

The tool, hook, and provider implementations (the actual business logic) largely stay the same -- they get new function signatures matching the SDK's request/response models, but the logic inside is unchanged.

## Open Questions

1. **gRPC vs HTTP** -- Deferred to implementation phase. The SDK can abstract the transport. HTTP is simpler to debug (curl), gRPC has better streaming semantics. Decide when benchmarking is possible.
2. **Auth between services** -- Dapr provides mTLS by default, sufficient for local Docker Compose. Revisit for production deployment.
3. **Provider streaming mechanics** -- Does the provider service publish tokens directly to pub/sub, or does the orchestrator receive a streaming response and republish? Orchestrator-mediated is simpler for now.
4. **Sub-session spawning (delegation)** -- When the orchestrator delegates to a child agent, the Session Service needs to spin up a new session with potentially different services. How does this compose with Docker Compose where all services are already running? Likely: all services are always running, the Session Service just selects different subsets per session.
5. **Behavior composition at runtime** -- Can an agent definition activate/deactivate behaviors mid-session, or is the behavior set fixed at session start?
